Description:
* For our final project, the metric that we ultimately decided upon was the best place to raise a child. Thus, for our sub-metrics, Mason chose to discover which area has the most playground equipment; more playgrounds = more happiness. Aaron picked to find which area has the least firearm seizures; fewer confiscations = more safety. Quinn selected to uncover which area has the greatest household size; the more, the merrier.
